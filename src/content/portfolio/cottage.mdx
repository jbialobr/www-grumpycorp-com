## Writer's cottage

  <div class="accent-mono">

_March 2019_

Perched among the trees behind the main house, the cottage is designed to be a year-round creative space for one.
With floor-to-ceiling windows, its calm, light-filled environment provides just enough space for a typewriter, plenty of books, and a couch.
The desk was sourced from a tree that was taken down when the adjoining house was built.

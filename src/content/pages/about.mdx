Hi, I'm Robin (thus <Icon sprite={GrumpyRobin} className="h1 w1" />).
I've been working in one way or another for almost 25 years and am currently taking some time off.
I'm using this time to explore, learn, and take care of a bunch of things that have queued up over the years.

<span class="grumpycorp">GRUMPYCORP</span> is the name of my movie studio / consulting company / record label / construction outfit, whatever it ends up being.

If you want my help on anything - a project, a problem, an opportunity - don't hesitate to [ask](mailto:robin@grumpycorp.com).

### Ambitions

- Complete a major labor-of-love project
  - Design and build a [writer's cottage](/tags/posts/cottage/) in the back yard
- Become ~~a credible~~ any kind of film editor
  - Make a short film
  - Make the soundtrack for said short film
  - Help friends make and edit films
- ~~Figure out whether food could be a livelihood~~
  - Figure out how to help with a restaurant
    - design and build-out - _Still need to connect up with an old friend on that_
    - ~~dishwashing~~
    - ~~cooking (I'm a licensed Washington State food worker)~~ done it, doesn't pay
  - Cook all the things - _[working on it](/tags/posts/food/)_
- Needlessly geek out with current technology
  - Automate my house's radiant heat system into IoT nirvana
- ~~Read~~

### Lessons learned

- _Just do it right the first time_ is the constant refrain from the [cottage](/tags/posts/cottage/) project, my primary occupation over the last eight months.
- Food is wonderful but don't make it a livelihood unless you enjoy it so much that you don't mind 60+ hour work weeks for minimum wage pay. Duh.
- There's some amazing stuff on Netflix and friends these days (_The Fall_, _Killing Eve_, _Russian Doll_, etc.) - that makes wanting to read harder.

Hi, I'm Robin. 
I've been working in one way or another for almost 25 years and have recently been given the amazing opportunity to take some time off.
I intend to use this time to explore, learn, and take care of a bunch of things that have queued up over the years.

{{< grumpycorp >}} is the name of my movie studio / consulting company / record label, whatever it ends up being - likely several of these and more.

If you want my help on anything - a project, a problem, an opportunity - don't hesitate to [ask](mailto:robin@grumpycorp.com).

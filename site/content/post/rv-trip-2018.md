We just returned from a week-ish-long RV trip with the family that (to me) was some form of love song to my parents.
Overall it was a pretty successful trip despite some cuts and changes - we saw lots of things, nobody murdered anyone (despite some close calls),
and I think we'd all do it again (albeit differently - see _Lessons Learned_ below.)

With this being some form of love song to my parents, I will go in full-on 'my dad' mode and present some data.

This correlates with interstate driving, followed by state road and smaller roads driving, then back to interstate driving,
and curiously enough interstate driving getting us worse fuel efficiency, even though we often hit similar speeds on local roads. Interesting!

## Lessons learned
- It's not a great idea to execute on an RV trip with a tight schedule.
  - If the weather doesn't cooperate (we got rained out in Bryce Canyon and in Yellowstone for a day each), you have to start cutting aggressively and that sucks.
    We ended up skipping our planned stop at Arches N.P. to get another day at Bryce, and just had to phone it in at Yellowstone. Instead, we got more time to hang out,
    read, and play games, and that was okay too, just not what I'd expected.
  - If anything goes wrong (even as simple as extra stops required for dog pees, general kid/cat herding/etc.), days get out of whack and it's unpleasant.
- It'd be nice to travel less per day, whenever possible. Aim for less ambitious trips, spend more time at State Parks instead of just the big-name National Parks, etc.
- Don't underestimate the stress of having no quiet place to escape to in a small RV with six people.

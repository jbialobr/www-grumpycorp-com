A few years ago we were tremendously fortunate to get to build our dream house with the amazing folks at [Build LLC](https://www.buildllc.com/).

I had wanted to carve out some future work for myself for the property, so the idea of the _Writer's Cottage_ was born - 
a detached space that worked as a shed (as far as code was concerned), could be used as private space from time to time,
and matched the design of the house precisely. Since we had a bunch of the siding panels left, we might as well do something with them...

The existing house is clean Danish Modern with a simple shed roof, aluminum windows, and a mix of aluminum panel and wood siding:

On the inside, the windows are floor-to-ceiling and all trim is museum-style, i.e. recessed:

I wanted to keep the cottage as simple as possible, if there is such a thing, so I settled on an 8'x12' footprint
with a door on the bottom left, full-height windows in the front and back walls, and a clerestory window along the back wall wherever it wasn't full-height window.
The roof is a simple shed roof at the same angle as the existing house's roof, with interior ceiling height going from 8' to 9' and a bit. 
The roof also has a 3' overhang over the door, with a small deck underneath that.

Off to AutoCAD I went:

And a sketchy-looking perspective rendering showing the back elevation and the entry door:

I wanted to get power and internet to the cottage so we ran some trenches last year while our landscapers were still around:

We also poured some footings at the time in holes generously dug by our landscaping crew.

And now - we build! 
I'm treating myself to engineered lumber (LVLs, I-joists, PSL studs) wherever possible so I don't have to keep sorting through bent-as-hell studs every day.
We'll see how that goes...

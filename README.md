Website for GrumpyCorp Heavy Industries (via Hugo).

Based in part on the [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal) theme.

## Setup
System prep for Windows: `choco install visualstudio2017-workload-vctools` or just install Visual Studio with native tools. May also need to `set PYTHON=3.7` as appropriate.

`npm install`, `npm start`.
